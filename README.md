## This Github repository hosts a React front end app that demonstrates these project deliverables: 

## To Get Started, You'll Need to: 

1. Clone the repository 
2. Run NPM Install (to install project dependencies) 
3. Run NPM NetDev (to inject an api key and netlify functions to access the Freel Meal API)
4. If you need an api key, I use the 
https://www.themealdb.com/api.php API 
Note: They do not have an API key parameter. I stored my API in a .env file and then created a global const variable. I could then add this const variable to my API async await Netlify function

## You Can Also Find the Deployed App Here:

## Here are Key Project Deliverables to This Repository: 


1. Effectively use conditional logic and JavaScript array methods(e.g. Filter, Map, Reduce, Find) to render large lists.


2. Encapsulate your code as React functional components.


3. Work with command-line tools and NPM to create and manage your project within a real development toolset.
4. Allow communication between components using props and the Context API.


5. Present a form for user input that provides useful form validation and feedback for at least 3 data input items (e.g. name, password).


6. Create at least 5 custom components and use them within at least two of your other components.


7. Use a mix of CSS animations and Transition Component transitions to enhance some aspects of your project.


8. Connect to a server using Netlify functions and display retrieved data including at least 5 item details (accessed by details route) in your UI.


9. Provide at least 3 different routes with navigation between them using React Router.


10. Manage your application's general and signup/login Authentication state using Hooks and the Context API.


11. Structure, document, and deploy your final project code according to common industry practices.


12. You will submit the GitHub URL for your project AND the URL of where your project is deployed online (Netlify).  The ReadMe file in your GitHub repo will list where in your code each of the required features listed above can be found.
